# CameraTrapChallenge
(PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

This project is part of the CameraTrapChallenge, which aims to develop algorithms for analyzing camera trap data.

## Coherant Sequence Identification
This folder contains code to identify coherant sequence of images from a group of images which contains several scenes using Structural Similarity Index (SSI) of Scikit-Image. SSI is a measure of the similarity between two images, based on the degree of structural distortion that would be required to align the images.

To use this code, you will need to create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. To do this, navigate to the folder containing the code and run the following commands in the terminal:

To create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```
To activate the created environment:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
To install pip dependencies for the sequence_identification_without_plot.py:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Open jupyter notebook and play around :heavy_check_mark:
```
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Goals
1. Identify coherent sequences of images (over time) for both Badger and Deer Dataset :ballot_box_with_check: YOU ARE HERE :eye_speech_bubble:
2. Locate the animals in the images (rough position) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: coherant_sequence
3. Classify the animals (badger vs. deer) :ballot_box_with_check: Folder: custom-yolov7
4. Extend the BDD dataset with at least 2 additional species (at least 50 images each, day or day & night) of your choice (called BDD+)
5. Locate the animals in the images (alternative method)
6. Classify the animals into the min. 4 classes (alternative method)
